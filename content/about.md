# Ke-Jou (Carol) Hsu

**Ke-Jou (Carol) Hsu** has worked in computer systems for years. 
Her research began with HPC and virtualization at National Tsing Hua University (advised by [Jerry Chou](https://lsalab.cs.nthu.edu.tw/member/advisor)), 
focusing on deploying and running HPC workloads in the cloud. 
Later, as an industry engineer, she worked on public cloud service backends, 
specializing in Linux containers, microservices, and Kubernetes.

She recently completed her PhD at Georgia Institute of Technology (advised by [Ada Gavrilovska](https://sites.cc.gatech.edu/home/ada/)), 
expanding her system studies into edge computing on 5G networks. 
Her work explores efficient, fast, and observable system support for edge workloads.

AnecdoteðŸ¤“ -- My mandarin name ```Ke-Jou (å…‹æŸ”)``` sounds like ```Carol```, 
a name given by my first English teacher. I uses it in tech and with foreign friends for simplicity.
