    A space where I gather thoughts on things that interest me. Expect posts on:

    - **System Software**: Technologies around resource management and container orchestration.
    - **Language study**: Both programming and human ones.
    - **Travel**: History, culture, and the vibes from places I've visited.
    - **Japanese Anime**: Full-on otaku mode for what I love.

    Hoping to keep this going.. Let's see how it goes ヾ(*´∀ ˋ*)ﾉ
