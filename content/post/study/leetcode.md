This post isn't about how to *win* anything with LeetCode. 
It's just a collection of my thoughts (and maybe some complaints), 
along with notes that are probably only useful to me.

I don't need to introduce LeetCode --- it's already well known for 
its massive database of coding challenges and technical questions. 
Many candidates use it to prepare for interviews in software engineering and related fields.
Still, there are some ethical gray areas with platforms like this:
- How are the questions collected?
How do they find out which interview problems are used by which companies?

- They do make money. 
While users openly share solutions and discussions, arguably the sweetest part of the platform, 
is there any kind of reward system for those who contribute the most?

- Candidates can ace a question quickly in an interview simply 
because they just practiced a nearly identical one 

Maybe that's why LeetCode has become a sort of "He Who Must Not Be Named". 
When companies send out coding interview instructions, 
they often reference other materials. 
But in reality, most well-prepared candidates use LeetCode behind the scenes.

## Why Do I Start Doing LeetCode Every Day Recently?

Compared to senior software engineering roles,
the positions I'm aiming for donâ€™t seem to emphasize coding interviews as heavily, 
in terms of time pressure or difficulty.
I've heard that competitive engineering roles often involve 3~5 rounds of intense coding tests.
So, why do I practice LeetCode daily?

Well, simply because I enjoy it.
I like brainstorming and solving problems. 
Before LeetCode, I spent time on 
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) and [CheckIO](https://checkio.org) with Python.
I switched to LeetCode about a year ago for a few reasons (I still play some on the other two):

- **Time**: 
I started dedicating more time to coding challenges, 
which made me want to try harder or more varied problems. 
But I also needed a way to limit how much time I spent on each one. 
That's where LeetCode helps: the Daily Challenge and [Weekly Contest](https://leetcode.com/contest/)
--- I aim to finish a problem within a day or solve several in 1.5 hours during contests. 
It keeps things balanced and time-boxed.

{{< figure src="/image/leetcode_daily.png" caption="LeetCode Daily Challenge tracks the streak and motivates me to check in every day. The daily problem appears at the top of the list. For example, today's is No. 1550." >}}

- **Community**: 
LeetCode has a huge user base. 
Even if I don't actively post or answer questions, 
reading through other people's discussions really helps clarify my thinking when I'm stuck. 
And since there's rarely single solution, exploring different approaches helps me grow.

- **Challenging test cases**: 
Because LeetCode is designed with interviews in mind, brute-force solutions often fail. 
If you write something naive, you'll probably get hit with a follow-up like "What if the input is huge?". 
The platform expects you to understand space and time complexity, 
and to improve your solution accordingly. 
I like that challenge --- it's not just about making it work, but making it better.

Sounds intense, right? Don't worry, I set boundaries. 
I know there are lots of other important or interesting things I need to do every day, 
so I don't go all in. 
For example, as you can see in the screenshot above, 
I skipped the problem on the 9th, because I still cannot figure it out. That's my limits ðŸ˜†.


## How Hard Do We Really Need to Grind for Interview Tests?

LeetCode problems are designed to be solved quickly, 
unlike the problems in contests of the cancelled [Google Code Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Code_Jam) or
the Olympic-level [ACM ICPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest).
Some people prepare extremely hard, solving hundreds of problems to build muscle memory: 
"Ah, I've seen this pattern before -- I'll just apply that trick."
Even though I'm currently job hunting too, I don't agree with that approach. 
Why? Because it's kind of insane. 
I want to code for fun, not for the sake of passing a flawed interview process.

Sure, being able to solve LeetCode problems quickly and accurately 
shows that you've worked hard to prepare. 
But that doesn't directly prove you're a good engineer. 
There's a lot more that matters: 
real-world technical skills, how you think, how you communicate, and most importantly,
whether you'd be a good teammate.

For coding interviews, I will just keep following key methods in mind:

- Well-known about the syntax and coding style of the language you picked, 
only used the package/library that you know how they practically work.

- Well understand the problems: input, output, and thinking of the boundary cases

To be honest, 
my goal with LeetCoding is to collect those visual coins and redeem some goodies.
If I ever earn enough, I'm definitely showing off the prize.

Happy Coding and Happy Mother's Day!
